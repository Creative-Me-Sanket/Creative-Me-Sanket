# SmartTransportManagementSystem
Smart Transport System is an smart delivery web based application which automates transport operations The main job of this application is to provide a transport service to cosigner and consignee without being physically present.
Currently the vendors work individual and are depend on the local customers where they need to individually manage each and every operations of the transport service. 
Finding the vehicle during the time of emergency is very crucial for consignor to transport their goods from source to destination.

They are not able to figure out which vendor they should rely on for consignment to be done.

It becomes difficult to find which vehicle will be travelling from a particular location especially if we are in unknown geographical region as there is no integrated platform where all the vendors are tied at one platform.

There is lack of security and authenticity of the vehicles and drivers in the existing system as there is no standardization of the system.

So, Smart Transport Management System provides an integrated platform for the vendors where all the vendors are attached to one system where user gets a wide range of choices to choose any vendor at different location. This creates users to have multiple options for selecting their vendors with whom the can work efficiently.

This mini project has been implemented using Django Framework, Python and SQLite for making it very convenient for people to know the exact status location wise and they can book the vehicles without wasting much time in finding the vendor  with all the facilities.
